## Specificity about this infrastructure;

# What are firewalls for

A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing traffic, enforcing predefined security rules to protect against unauthorized access and cyber threats. It acts as a barrier between internal networks and external sources, such as the internet, ensuring only permitted traffic is allowed while blocking malicious activity.

# Why is the traffic served over HTTPS

HTTPS utilizes the SSL/TLS protocol to encrypt communications, preventing attackers from stealing data. Additionally, SSL/TLS verifies the authenticity of a website's server, thus preventing impersonations. This security measure parallels food safety practices, which prevent illnesses, and effectively thwarts various cyberattacks.

# What monitoring is used for

It's used to track the performance of the infrastructure and to monitor its availability. Additionally, it's utilized to ensure the security of the infrastructure. This monitoring process helps in identifying issues. It also aids in optimizing resource usage.

# How the monitoring tool is collecting data

Data collection is about gathering information from diverse sources to assess project or program success. Methods include qualitative (e.g., surveys, interviews) and quantitative (e.g., surveys, questionnaires) approaches, facilitating measurement of progress and identification of improvement areas. It enables tracking progress and comparing results with goals.

# Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS


Setting up a monitoring tool involves collecting and analyzing web server performance metrics to monitor the Query Per Second (QPS). This includes tracking request/response times and observing the number of queries processed per second. In the context of this infrastructure, an alternative method is to monitor it within Nginx logs, for instance.


##  Issues with this infrastructure;

# Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue

SSL termination at the load balancer presents a security concern as it involves transmitting unencrypted data from the load balancer to the App Server, potentially leaving applications vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle Attacks. While terminating SSL at the load balancer simplifies management and allows for centralized correction of SSL vulnerabilities, it raises trust issues regarding data security within the datacenter. Additionally, in scenarios involving third-party load balancers or CDNs, where traffic traverses untrusted networks, re-encrypting data or establishing secure VPN connections may be necessary to mitigate security risks.

# Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue

A single write server in MySQL creates a SPOF and hinders maintenance. Utilizing multiple write servers through replication methods like master-master or group replication addresses these concerns by providing better scaling, automatic failover, and ensuring data consistency.

# Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem

Having servers with all the same components, including the database, web server, and application server. The absence of diversity or redundancy in servers with identical components poses a risk. While hosting them on the same server may suffice for low-traffic sites, it's preferable to separate them to allow for independent scaling and optimize performance.
