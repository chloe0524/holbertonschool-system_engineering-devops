# Infrastructure Specifics

## Server
A server, which can be either a powerful computer hardware or software, provides functionality for other programs or devices, known as "clients". It manages data, devices, and systems over a network. A server, like any computer, operates on an underlying operating system that manages its software and hardware resources.

## Domain Name
Domain names are text-based labels that identify Internet resources. They are used by the Domain Name System (DNS) to map to websites and other Internet Protocol (IP) resources.

## DNS Record
The "www" in www.foobar.com typically corresponds to a 'A' DNS record-type. In DNS, an "A" record (Address Record) points a domain or subdomain to an IP address. It's one of the most common DNS records, and it's used to point a domain or subdomain to an IP address representing a server where the domain's website is hosted. 

## Web Server
A web server is a computer system that uses HTTP to respond to client requests over the internet. It stores, processes, and delivers web content to users.

## Application Server
An application server enhances a web server's capabilities by handling dynamic content generation, application logic, and integration with other resources.

## Database
A database is an organized collection of data managed by a database management system (DBMS). It structures data for efficient querying and processing with SQL.

## Communication Protocol
Web servers communicate with web browsers using HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) manages the channels between the browser and server.

# Infrastructure Issues

## Single Point of Failure (SPOF)
A SPOF is a component within a system that, if it fails, can render the entire system non-operational.

## Downtime for Maintenance
Planned downtime refers to scheduled periods during which production equipment is intentionally limited or halted for maintenance, repairs, upgrades, or testing.

## Scalability Issues
Scaling a website involves adding resources to handle increased traffic. Challenges include optimizing assets, managing dependencies, and ensuring efficient database and session handling.
